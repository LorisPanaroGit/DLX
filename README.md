# DLX
VHDL implementation of DLX processor (basic version)

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a DLX (MIPS-like) processor. DLX is a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) architecture designed to be simple, yet powerful. The DLX processor follows a load-store architecture, where all arithmetic and logical operations are performed on registers, and memory access is done explicitly through load and store instructions.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive and modular implementation of a DLX processor. It includes the following components:

Instruction set architecture (ISA): The DLX instruction set and its encoding scheme.
Assembler: A program that converts assembly code written in the DLX assembly language into machine code.
Simulator: An execution environment that simulates the behavior of the DLX processor, allowing you to run programs written in DLX assembly language.
Example programs: A collection of DLX assembly language programs to demonstrate the usage and capabilities of the DLX processor.
